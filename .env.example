# No environment variables strictly required for the demo backend 
# as we are decoding tokens without signature verification (for demo simplicity)
# and storing Gemini keys in the database per user.
# 
# If you enable signature verification in auth.py, you would need:
# CLERK_ISSUER=...
# CLERK_PEM_PUBLIC_KEY=...
